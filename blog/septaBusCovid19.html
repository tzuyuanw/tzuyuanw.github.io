	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<div class="blurb">
		<p> Since Philadelphia announced the stay at home order on March 23, SEPTA has modified its schedule three major times for its bus, trolley, and subways. 
			It started operating Saturday schedule for everyday on March 22. 
			Then on April 9, SEPTA further reduced its bus service to around 60 core routes. 
			On April 26, SEPTA changed most of its bus routes that it still operated to headway based, resulting in a slightly lower number of daily trips served. 
			Finally on May 17, SEPTA returned to its regular summer schedule.</p>

		<P> Even though decrease in service level is drastic, 
			
			Interestingly, since SEPTA begin operating Saturday schedule for everyday, a few areas in the suburb of Philadelphia actually experienced
			a higher frequency bus service during late April and early May.
