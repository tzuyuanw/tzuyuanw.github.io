title: SEPTA Bus Service Changes Due to Covid-19

	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<div class="blurb">
		<p> Since Philadelphia announced the stay at home order on March 23, SEPTA has modified its schedule three major times for its bus, trolley, and subways. 
			It started operating Saturday schedule for everyday on March 22. 
			Then on April 9, SEPTA further reduced its bus service to around 60 core routes, calling this the lifeline service.  
			On April 26, SEPTA changed most of its bus routes that it still operated to headway based, resulting in a slightly lower number of daily trips served. 
			Finally on May 17, SEPTA returned to its regular summer schedule. It is important to note that even though decrease in service level is drastic, 
			this already represents an overestimate of the total number of bus trips operated by SEPTA. During the reduced service period, 
			SEPTA did not operate trips when a bus driver is not available. They allow the trip to be missed, resulting in a higher missed trip rate than usual.
		</p>
		<p>Before the pandemic, SEPTA operated around 14,000 daily bus trips on weekdays, 8,500 on Saturdays, and 6,700 on Sundays. 
			During the period when SEPTA operated Saturday schedule for everyday, 
			the number of daily bus trips were around 8,600 with minor fluctuation based on days of the week. 
			Lastly, during the lifeline service, it ran in between 4,700 and 4,400 daily trips according to GTFS schedule.

		<p> 
			Counting the weekday daily frequency at stops yield large decreases throughout the system.
			This is the result of the shift to operating on Saturday schedule and then further decreasing service.
			Interestingly, since SEPTA begin operating Saturday schedule for everyday, 
			a few areas in the suburb of Philadelphia actually experienced
			a higher frequency bus service during late April and early May.

		<p>From comparing the routes that were suspended with the lifeline service, 
			it can be seen that SEPTA largely preserved the extend of its service, 
			however reduced the density of its network. Routes in operation during lifeline service were more spread out, 
			especially in center city Philadelphia. Several routes connecting outlying suburbs, without entering the city were also suspended.

		<p> Notes on Data Processing and Data Sources:<br/>
			This analysis uses SEPTA's publically available GTFS data covering the period between February 23 to July 13, 2020. 
			The data was prcessed in R to calculate the number of trips scheduled for each day at both the system and stop level. 
			The graph and map illustrated were also created in R, using packages such as ggplot2, plotly, and leaflet.
