				<p class="fs-1">Calculating Land Use Index</p>
				<p>When working on a project that aims to investigate the characteristics of transit choice riders, 
                    I calculated an index that measures the land use diversity in a traffic analysis zone (TAZ) in Philadelphia. 
                    This process uses ArcGIS, R, Shiny and Leaflet. The process is explained below. 
                    
				</p>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Transportation and land use is closely connected, with one influencing the other.
                    As such, when building transportation related model, there is often a need to introduce 
                    a measurement of the diversity of land use in an area. This document describes the process 
                    used to calculate an index that measures the diversity of land uses. 
				</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Data Sources</h3>
				<p>Two spatial datasets were used for this calculation.  
				</p>
				<p><b>Land Use Data</b><br/>
					The land use data was provided by Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), 
                    the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Philadelphia region, 
                    through their publically accessible GIS data website. 
                    It was created using aerial surveillance imagery captured in the spring of 2015.
				</p>
				
				<p><b>TAZ Boundary Data</b><br/>
					The TAZ polygon shapefile was provided by DVRPC as well. 
                    This shapefile includes all the TAZs within the jurisdiction of the MPO.
				</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Calculation Process</h3>
				<p>For this analysis, the calculation process was separated into two parts. 
                    The first part uses ArcGIS and the second part uses R.
				</p>
                <p><b>GIS Processing</b><br/>
                    Since the land use data often crosses TAZ boundaries 
                    and does not have location attribute associated with each feature, 
                    they needed to be processed using GIS software before it can be used in the calculation. 
                    When comparing land uses in different TAZs, 
                    it can be seen that small TAZs tend to be located within the city and have a high land use diversity, 
                    while large TAZs tend to be located in the suburbs. Even though large TAZs can be diverse when considering 
                    the entire TAZ, they are often not diverse locally. To account for this discrepancy, 
                    a buffer of 800-meter radius around the centroid of the TAZ was created 
                    to measure the diversity of land use for the TAZ. The land use data was then intersected 
                    with the TAZ buffers. This creates features that both conforms to the boundary of each 
                    TAZ buffer and contains the TAZ information. Then, the area of each feature after the 
                    intersection was calculated.
                </p>
                <p><b>Index Calculation</b><br/>
                    The output from GIS was then brought into R to for the calculation of the index. 
                    The calculation is based on the following formula:
                </p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="landUseIndexFormula.png" height="30%" width="15%" alt="test image" class="image"/>
                    <p class="fw-lighter">
                        <br>
                        Where <i>A<sub>ij</sub></i> is the percent of land use <i>i</i> in the buffer of TAZ <i>j</i>, 
                        <i>N</i> is number of land use categories considered
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <p><br>
                    For this calculation, the land use categories include commercial, residential, and institutional. 
                    All other categories of land use were excluded from the calculation because 
                    even if those land use categories provide greater diversity of land use, 
                    they do not contribute significantly to creating a land use pattern that influences transit usage decisions. 
                    This resulted in an index ranging from 0 to 1, 
                    where 0 represents no land use diversity and 1 represents a high degree of mixture. 
                    In this case the land use index ranges from 0 to 0.99. 
                    This calculation uses a formula first introduced by Frank and Pivo (1994) in their paper on 
                    “Impacts of Mixed Use and Density on Utilization of Three Modes of Travel: 
                    Single-Occupant Vehicle, Transit, and Walking.”
                </p>

                <h3>Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                    The following map displays the calculated land use index for each TAZ in the Philadelphia region. 
                    From the map it can be seen that areas with high index value (close to one) are located along
                    transportation corridors and urban centers.
