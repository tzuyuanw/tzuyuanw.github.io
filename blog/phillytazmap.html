   		<p>This map illustrates the TAZ of the Philadelphia Region. TAZ is a unit of analysis often used to study traffic flows of a city.
		</p>
		<p> Since Philadelphia issued the stay at home order, SEPTA has modified its schedule three major times for its bus, trolley, and subways. 
			It started operating Saturday schedule for everyday on March 22. 
			Then on April 9, SEPTA further reduced its bus service to around 60 core routes. 
			On April 26, SEPTA changed most of its bus routes to headway based, resulting in a slightly lower number of trips served. </p>
