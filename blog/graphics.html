		<p> This page presents a collection of graphics I made as a graduate student and a research assistant. 
			These graphics were made using a combination of ArcGIS, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop.

		<h3>Workshop</h3>
		<p>In workshop, I was responsible for preparing a summary of the existing condition on transportation 
			as well as creating graphics for proposed interventions relating to transportation in the community.

		<p><b>Fare Capping</b><br/>
			This graphic was created to explain the concept of fare capping. 
			A fare system with this mechanism caps the total amount of payment so that frequent riders pay the same amount 
			per month or week as people who purchased a pass. 
			This allows frequent riders who could not pay for a monthly or weekly pass to also benefit from the reduced cost of riding transit.
