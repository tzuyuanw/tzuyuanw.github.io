		<p> This page presents a collection of graphics I made as a graduate student and a research assistant. 
			These graphics were made using a combination of ArcGIS, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop.

		<h3>Workshop</h3>
		<p>In workshop, I was responsible for preparing a summary of the existing condition on transportation 
			as well as creating graphics for proposed interventions relating to transportation in the community.

		<p><b>Fare Capping</b><br/>
			This graphic was created to explain the concept of fare capping. 
			A fare system with this mechanism caps the total amount of payment so that frequent riders pay the same amount 
			per month or week as people who purchased a pass. 
			This allows frequent riders who could not pay for a monthly or weekly pass to also benefit from the reduced cost of riding transit.

		<p><b>Street Sections</b><br/>
			The following street sections illustrates proposed streetscape improvements to create a more pedestrian friendly environment. 
			When analyzing the existing condition, 
			we noticed that the community is very car oriented with wide streets and poorly marked pedestrian crossings. 
			We proposed interventions such as curb extension at intersections, parking protected bike lanes. 
			The community is also bisected by a freight rail viaduct running above a street. 
			For this space, we proposed that part of the street can be closed for community events that helps activate the space 
			and connects both sides of the community.
