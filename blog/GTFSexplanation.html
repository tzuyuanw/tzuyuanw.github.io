   		<p>This page explains the main files that make up the GTFS data and their relationship with each other. 
			It is important to note that there are variation among different transit operators in the way they publish their GTFS data. 
			Even with a set format, different transit agencies may choose to provide different amount of information. 
			For instance, not all transit agencies include a frequencies file. 
			Never the less, the basic information such as stops, routes, and scheules can still be determined from the GTFS data.
			The best way to understand the GTFS data is to open the files and see the types of information provided. 
		</p>
		<h3>Files</h3>
		<p><b>Routes:</b><br/>
			The route text file presents information of all the routes, including their route number and their route name. 
			There is also a <i>route_id</i> that identifies each route. 
			It may also indicate the route type which could be the type of vehicle used (trolley, buses, heavy rail ,etc.).	
		</p>
		<p><b>Trips:</b><br/>
			The trip file contains information on each trip that is scheduled to operate. 
			It identifies each unique trip by its ID (<i>trio_id</i>). It indicates which route, block, and direction is associated with the trip. 
			It also provides a code that shows which days of the week the trip operates. 
			The file also indicates the information shown on the headsign for each trip.  			
		</p>
		<p><b>Stops:</b><br/>
			The stop file lists all the stops (station) in the system. It provides a unique identifier for each stop (<i>stop_id</i>) as well as its name. 
			It also provides the location, specified with longitude and latitude.
