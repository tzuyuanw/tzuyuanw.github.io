   		<p>This page explains the main files that make up the GTFS data and their relationship with each other. 
			It is important to note that there are variation among different transit operators in the way they publish their GTFS data. 
			Even with a set format, different transit agencies may choose to provide different amount of information. 
			For instance, not all transit agencies include a frequencies file. 
			Never the less, the basic information such as stops, routes, and scheules can still be determined from the GTFS data.
			The best way to understand the GTFS data is to open the files and see the types of information provided.
