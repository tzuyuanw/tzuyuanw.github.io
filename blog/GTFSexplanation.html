	<div class="blurb">
   		<p>This page explains the main files that make up the GTFS data and their relationship with each other. 
			It is important to note that there are variation among different transit operators in the way they publish their GTFS data. 
			Even with a set format, different transit agencies may choose to provide different amount of information. 
			For instance, not all transit agencies include a frequencies file. 
			Never the less, the basic information such as stops, routes, and scheules can still be determined from the GTFS data.
			The best way to understand the GTFS data is to open the files and see the types of information provided. 
		</p>
		<h3>Files</h3>
		<p>The GTFS data consists of multiple text files. 
			The six main ones are Routes, Trips, Stop_Times, Calendar, and Frequencies. 
			This section explains each of the main files within the GTFS data.
		</p>
		<p><b>Routes:</b><br/>
			The Route text file presents information of all the routes, including their route number and their route name. 
			There is also a <i>route_id</i> that identifies each route. 
			It may also indicate the route type which could be the type of vehicle used (trolley, buses, heavy rail ,etc.).	
		</p>
		<p><b>Trips:</b><br/>
			The Trip file contains information on each trip that is scheduled to operate. 
			It identifies each unique trip by its ID (<i>trio_id</i>). It indicates which route, block, and direction is associated with the trip. 
			It also provides a code that shows which days of the week the trip operates. 
			The file also indicates the information shown on the headsign for each trip.  			
		</p>
		<p><b>Stops:</b><br/>
			The Stop file lists all the stops or station in the system. 
			It provides a unique identifier for each stop (<i>stop_id</i>) as well as its name. 
			It also provides the location, specified with longitude and latitude. 
		</p>
		<p><b>Stop-Times:</b><br/>
			The Stop_times file marks the arrival and departure time at a stop. 
			Each entry in the file records a stop made by a trip. 
			Each entry also includes the unique trip identifier (<i>trip_id</i>), 
			the unique stop identifier (<i>stop_id</i>) as well as the number indicating the sequence at which the stops are made. 
		</p>
		<p><b>Calendar:</b><br/>
			The Calendar file includes a code (<i>service_id</i>) and which day of the week this code is associated with. 
			This code is used to indicate the days the trip operates on.
