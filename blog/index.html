		In the spring of 2020, transit agencies across the country scaled back its service due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
		As part of a research project to understand ridership changes during the pandemic, 
		I used the GTFS data published by SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority) 
		to understand the scale of service cuts in the Philadelphia region.

		As a research assistant, I often use GTFS data to understand the level of transit service. 
		This guide came from my experience using GTFS in the past two years. 
		Even though there are small variation in the way transit operators use GTFS, 
		the page explains the main structure and relationship of files that make up GTFS data.
