		In the spring of 2020, transit agencies across the country scaled back its service due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
		As part of a research project to understand ridership changes during the pandemic, 
		I used the GTFS data published by SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority) 
		to understand the scale of service cuts in the Philadelphia region.
