   		<p>I want to take this opportunity to share with you some of the recipes that works for me.
			Most of the recipes included here came from others, with some small tweaks that I made
			after making the dishes several times.

			<p>This book was born as I was hungry. Let me explain. In the spring of 1996, my second book, a novel, came
			out in Canada. It didn't fare well. Reviewers were puzzled, or damned it with faint praise. Then readers
			ignored it. Despite my best efforts at playing the clown or the trapeze artist, the media circus made no
			difference. The book did not move. Books lined the shelves of bookstores like kids standing in a row to play
			baseball or soccer, and mine was the gangly, unathletic kid that no one wanted on their team. It vanished
			    quickly and quietly.
