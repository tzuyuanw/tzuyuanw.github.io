				<p>Having pancakes for breakfast is a wonderful thing...</p>
				<p>This recipe is easy to remember and allows you to make your own pancake from scratch. 
					After I started using this recipe, I never bought another box of pancake mix. 
					This recipe originally came from Jamie Oliver's Foodtube recipes on YouTube.

				<h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>
				<ul class="ingredients">
				<li>1 Cup Self Raising Flour</li>
				<li>1 Cup Milk</li>
				<li>1 Egg</li>
				<li>A Few Drops of Vanilla Extract (Optional)</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="steps">
				<h3 class="ingredients">Steps:</h3>
				<ol class="steps">
				<li>Put all the ingredients in a mixing bowl.</li>
				<li>Whisk everything together until there are almost no clumps.</li>
				<li>Add a tea spoon of oil to a non-stick pan and turn the stove to medium high heat.</br>
					You could also use cooking oil sprays. </br> MAKE SURE you spray first before turning on the stove!!</li>
				<li>Once the pan is hot, scoop a spoon full of pancake mix.</br>
					The amount of pancake mix you add into the pan determines the size of the pancake. You can
					always add more imediately after the first scoop if you feel like it is too small.</li>
				<li>When the pancake starts to form bubbles on the surface then it is time to flip.</br> 
					Bubbling is generally a sign that the pancake is ready to be flipped, however 
					you can always take a peak to see the side facing the pan has the right color.</li>
				<li>After the pancake is flipped cook for another minute to a minute and a half or until the color looks right. </li>
				<li>Now you can repeat steps 4 through 6 and make as many pancakes as you want!!</li>
				</ol>

				<h3 class="ingredients">Notes:</h3>
				<ul class="notes">
					<li> About cooking sprays... NEVER spray near flames. You can set everything on fire and burn yourself.
						This is coming from personal experience. Please don't try. </li>
					<li> You can make your pancakes as big as you want. The two things limiting the size of your pancakes
						are the size of your pan and the your ability to flip it. </li>
					<li> If your pan allows, you can cook multiple pancakes at once. I tend to make giant pancakes so I do it
						one at a time. I have noticed that I do not have to add more cooking oil when I cook the second and third 
						pancakes. </li>
